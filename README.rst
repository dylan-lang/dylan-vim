Dylan support for Vim
=====================

These scripts provide syntax highlighting for Dylan and Dylan-related
files for the Vim editor.

To use them locally, place them in your local ``.vim`` directory::

    ~/.vim/syntax/

We will start to merge these with the upstream versions in Vim in
the near future once it seems like the major issues have been
addressed.

Patches are welcome!
